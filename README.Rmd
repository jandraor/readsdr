## Overview

The goal of readsdr is to bridge the design capabilities from specialised
System Dynamics software with the powerful numerical tools offered by R 
libraries. The package accomplishes this goal by parsing .xmile files 
(Vensim and [Stella](https://www.iseesystems.com/) models) into R objects to
construct [networks](https://igraph.org) (graph theory), ODE functions for 
[deSolve](http://desolve.r-forge.r-project.org/) and 
[Stan](https://mc-stan.org/).

## Installation

You can install the released version of readsdr from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("readsdr")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:


``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jandraor/readsdr")
```

## Usage

```{r example}
library(readsdr)
filepath <- system.file("models/", "SIR.stmx", package = "readsdr")
mdl      <- read_xmile(filepath) 
```

For reading Vensim models, they must be exported as .xmile.

* [Basics](https://jandraor.github.io/tutorials/Basics.html)

* [Inference](https://jandraor.github.io/tutorials/Inference.html)

## Supported builtins

* **Stella**
    + Comparison operators (`=`, `<>`)
    + Logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) 
    + `If Else Then`
    + Inequality operators (`<`, `>`)
    + `Pulse` ^1^
    + `Step` ^1^
    + Endogenous table functions
    + Smoothing functions^2^: `SMTH1`, `SMTH3`, `SMTHN`
    + Delay functions: `DELAYN`
    + Limited support to *uni-dimensional* arrays. *Apply all* translation is restricted to numeric values.
    + Math functions: `ABS`, `EXP`, `SQRT` 
    + Stats functions: `NORMAL`^3^
* **Vensim**
    + Comparison operators (`=`, `<>`)
    + Logical operators (`:AND:`, `:OR:`, `:NOT:`) 
    + `IF_THEN_ELSE`
    + Inequality operators (`<`, `>`) 
    + `Pulse` ^1^
    + `Pulse Train` ^1^
    + `Step` ^1^
    + Endogenous table functions
    + Smoothing functions^2^: `SMOOTH`, `SMOOTH3`, `SMOOTH3I`, `SMOOTHI` 
    + Delay functions: `DELAY N`
    + Math functions: `ABS`, `EXP`, `SQRT` 
    + Limited support to *bi-dimensional* arrays.
    + Stats functions: `RANDOM NORMAL`^3^
    
^1^ Restricted to Euler integration.

^2^ These functions cannot be part of more complex mathematical expressions. That is, the auxiliary variable must only contain one smoothing function and **nothing else**.

^3^ Seed is ignored.

## Notes

* *uniflow* and *non-negative* stock features from _Stella_ are **not** supported.

* No built-in is supported for translations to _Stan_ code.

* Modules from _Stella_ are **not** supported.
