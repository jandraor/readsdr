Description: The goal of 'readsdr' is to bridge the design capabilities from
    specialised System Dynamics software with the powerful numerical tools 
    offered by 'R' libraries. The package accomplishes this goal by parsing 
    'XMILE' files ('Vensim' and 'Stella') models into 'R' objects to construct 
    networks (graph theory); 'ODE' functions for 'Stan'; and inputs to simulate
    via 'deSolve' as described in Duggan (2016) <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-34043-2>.
